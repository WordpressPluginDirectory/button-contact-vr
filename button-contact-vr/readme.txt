= Live Chat, Chatbots, and Popups via Formilla =

Buttonizer accounts get Formilla accounts integrated automatically. Both products are managed by the same team, so that means you get access to awesome features such as:

* **Unlimited Live Chats (free):** Chat with your visitors while they're on your website with our embedded widget; no need to send users to another browser tab!

* **Mobile Apps for iPhone, iPad, and Android Devices (free):** Chat via your mobile device or tablet by using our iPhone/iPad or Android apps!

* **Desktop Apps for Windows & Mac machines (free):** Chat via our dedicated desktop apps instead of our web dashboard to get online even faster.

* **Custom Branding, Colors, & Themes (free):** Customize your chat widgets to match your site's brand. Change the color of the chat button/widget, chat message and font color, backgrounds, etc. Upload your own online and offline live chat images to use in your header, footer, etc. to encourage customers to live chat!

* **Multi-Language Support and Custom Text (free):** Customize the text of your chat button/widget in any language of your choice! Easily customize the English text or modify it to read in Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, Polish, Chinese, Indonesian, and many more!

* **Popup Library (free with tiered limits):**  Popup Library with dozens of professionally designed marketing popups. Multiple display types including lightbox/modals, corner widgets, and website bars.  Announce a special sale, offer a coupon code, or market virtually anything to your visitors.

* **Real-time Visitor Monitoring:** See the number of active visitors on your website in real-time, and initiate live chats with them.  View the visitor's country, recently viewed web pages, referring site (e.g. did they come from a Google search, etc.), are they a new user vs. returning, IP address, operating system in use (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, etc.), internet browser, and more. Live Chat visitor monitoring is a paid feature and comes with our Professional package or higher.

* **Custom Chatbots:** Chatbots work around the clock to automatically qualify leads, book meetings, and provide information about your products or services to customers, even without having to chat with a live person! Chatbots can be added to any Premium package as a paid feature add-on.  Check out our [Custom Chat Bot](https://www.formilla.com/blog/how-to-create-custom-chat-bots "Custom Chat Bot") tutorial to learn more.

* **A.I. Chatbots:** Formilla Chat bots allow customers to dramatically reduce support time by setting up a Chatbot that automatically responds to common visitor questions at any time -- day or night -- using the power of Artificial Intelligence (paid feature add-on).  Check out our [Helper Chat Bot](https://www.formilla.com/blog/getting-started-with-a-helper-chat-bot "Helper Chat Bot") tutorial to learn more.

* **Pro-active Chat:** Enable pro-active chat to trigger automatically after a defined number of seconds (Premium packages). You can also configure a chatbot to do the same, with even more control over the user flow. For example, a chatbot can proactively popup to engage visitors and qualify them as leads before speaking with a live agent. This works with multiple types of custom chatbots you can create for your business.


= Example use cases for Buttonizer =

* <strong>The Buttonizer advantage</strong>. Buttonizer gives you the ability to manage different chat options at the same time. Each visitor is unique, and has a different communication preference. When you let your visitors chat with you using chat apps like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Viber, Telegram, etc, they have the freedom of chatting with you however they prefer, which increases engagement with your website.

* <strong>Launch your favorite live chat </strong>. While Formilla comes directly integrated, you can use JavaScript as one of your click actions to launch any other live chat product such as Hubspot, Tawk.to, Tidio, Chatra, Zoho, Zendesk, LiveChat, Crisp, Intercom and JivoChat.

* <strong>Connect with your visitors on WhatsApp Business</strong>. Connect WhatsApp Business to your site. Your visitors can start chatting with you on WhatsApp Business.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is a Floating Action Button and why should I use it? =

A floating action button is a button that 'floats' on the right corner of your website.

Maybe you noticed already that a lot of applications (mobile and web) have their primary floating action button (FAB), on the right corner of their website or app. You see this a lot with chat funtions. The Floating Action Button is becoming a standard in application and webdesign. Webvisitors are getting more and more used to the fact that there is a floating action button which is the primary action you can make on that page, on the right corner of a website.

The Buttonizer is a new way to give a boost to your number of interactions, actions and conversions from your website visitor by adding a Customizable Smart Multifunctional Floating Button in the corner of your website.

= What's the difference between floating action buttons or other conversion buttons? =

With Buttonizer you don't just add the same button to every page on your website. No, the key is that each action must be relevant. With the Buttonizer it's possible to add buttons to a select number of pages with "page rules", decide for each button if it shows on mobile and/or desktop, style your button with your own icons & colors, add social sharing buttons, Show the button on opening hours and make use of many more rules.

And the beauty of all: All actions are hidden in one button. The moment a visitor clicks on your Floating Action Button it will *pop* all specific buttons you've set for that page. Track each single button in Google Analytics so you can see which actions your visitors prefer.

In fact, Buttonizer is an addiction to use. Your website visitors will interact as never before.

= Which buttons are available with Buttonizer? =
WhatsApp chat, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, Email, SMS, Snapchat, X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Skype, Vkontakte, Phone (click to call), Telegram, Line, WeChat, Viber, Waze, Zalo, Google Maps, Poptin, Custom URL, Page Select.

= What widgets does Buttonizer support? =

We have the following widgets natively integrated:
- WhatsApp widget
- Facebook Messenger widget
- Contact form with Webhook support (PRO)
- Iframe widget (PRO)

Customize their position and visibility wherever you need. With the iframe widget you are able to show YouTube video's, integrate Calendly or any other page or website.

You can also interact with widgets using the Widget JavaScript API.

= I don’t see the button on my site, what should I do? =
Please make sure you’ve chosen at least one button and clicked on the green “Publish” button. If you still don't see any changes on the live site, you can clear the cache of your website if you have a caching plugin.

= How can I add a WhatsApp chat popup? =
Download the wordpress plugin, choose the WhatsApp templates, change your phone number, change the text and there you go. You can also choose the WhatsApp widget option to add a popup window. Don’t forget to enter the WhatsApp number with country code
E.g.
country code +1
number: 6123456789
** WhatsApp number: 16123456789 **

= Can I add multiple floating action buttons with the free version? =
Yes you can. You can make an unlimited amount of buttons and groups in Buttonizer.

= Does Buttonizer work on mobile? =
Yes, you can choose for each button if you want to display the button on mobile, desktop or both.

= Does Buttonizer support right-to-left languages? =
Languages can have a different direction of writing and reading? While languages such as English are written and read from left to right, other languages might follow the right-to-left style of script. Just considering the sheer number of language speakers, it is obvious that Buttonizer could not stay behind and has made sure to reserve the layout of the user interface to support right-to-left languages.
